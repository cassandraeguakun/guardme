                <strong>{{$data['employerCompany']}} also known as the "Company"</strong>
                <br>
                <br>

                <h4>1. STATUS OF THIS AGREEMENT</h4>
                <p>
                    This contract governs your engagement from time to time by the Company as a casual worker. This is
                    not an employment
                    contract and does not confer any employment rights on you (other than those to which workers are
                    entitled). In
                    particular, it does not create any obligation on the Company to provide work to you and by entering
                    into this
                    contract you confirm your understanding that the Company makes no promise or guarantee of a minimum
                    level of work to
                    you and you will work on a flexible, "as required" basis. It is the intention of both you and the
                    Company that there
                    be no mutuality of obligation between the parties at any time when you are not performing an
                    assignment.
                </p>
                <br>


                <h4>2. COMPANY'S DISCRETION AS TO WORK OFFERED</h4>
                <p>
                    It is entirely at the Company's discretion whether to offer you work and it is under no obligation
                    to provide work
                    to you at any time. The Company reserves the right to give or not give work to any person at any
                    time and is under
                    no obligation to give any reasons for such decisions.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4>3. NO PRESUMPTION OF CONTINUITY</h4>
                <p>
                    Each offer of work by the Company which you accept shall be treated as an entirely separate and
                    severable engagement
                    (an assignment). The terms of this contract shall apply to each assignment but there shall be no
                    relationship
                    between the parties after the end of one assignment and before the start of any subsequent
                    assignment. The fact that
                    the Company has offered you work, or offers you work more than once, shall not confer any legal
                    rights on you and,
                    in particular, should not be regarded as establishing an entitlement to regular work or conferring
                    continuity of
                    employment.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4>4. ARRANGEMENTS FOR WORK</h4>
                <p>
                    If the Company wants to offer you any work it will contact you by telephone and/or text. You must
                    provide accurate
                    contact details to the Company when requested. You are under no obligation to accept any work
                    offered by the Company
                    at any time. If you accept an assignment, you must inform the Company immediately if you will be
                    unable to complete
                    it for any reason. The Company reserves the right to terminate an assignment at any time for
                    operational reasons.
                    You will be paid for all work done during the assignment up to the time it is terminated.
                </p>
                <br>

                    other duties as
                    necessary to meet business needs. You will be informed of the requirements at the start of each
                    assignment. Before
                    offering you an assignment the Company will require certain documents from you in order to satisfy
                    itself that you
                    are legally entitled to work in the UK. You confirm that you are legally entitled to work in the UK

                    entitled at any
                    time.

                    informed of the
                    required hours for each assignment. You will be entitled to an unpaid lunch break of one hour where

                    the hours worked in the previous month. The Company will make all necessary deductions from your
                    salary as required
                    by law and shall be entitled to deduct from your pay or other payments due to you any money which
                    you may owe to the
                    Company at any time.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4>9. HOLIDAYS</h4>
                <p>
                    Your holiday entitlement will depend on the number of hours that you actually work and be pro-rated
                    on the basis of
                    a full-time entitlement of [28] days' holiday during each full holiday year (including public

                    ends. If you
                    have taken more holiday than your accrued entitlement at the date that your assignment ends, the
                    Company shall be
                    entitled to make deduction from any payment due to you in respect of such entitlement.
                </p>
                <br>
