Now what is my plan for Notifications = 

I will create 2 table ===

    table 1. = notifications (notification_type , message , user_id , notification_by_user_id , is_read )
    table 2. notifications_settings ( user_id , job_create_notify_status , job_awarded_notify_status)

now I will explain both these tables , table 1 will contain actual notifications data -

* notification_type = job_created | job_awarded (I am embedding two types of notification at first phase.....)
* user_id = id of user to which this notification was sent
* notification_by_user_id = id of user who send this notification
* message = actual text to be shown in notification (eg. you are hired for this job )
* is_read = 0|1 (0 means it is still to be viewed)


and table two will contain ON/OFF values for all the users for each type of notifications 

* user_id  = id of user
* job_awarded  = 0 | 1 (1 means job_awarded notifications will be sent to user_id ) 
* job_created = 0 | 1 (1 means job_created notifications will be sent to user_id )



HERE IS THE LIST OF APIS I CREATED ======
